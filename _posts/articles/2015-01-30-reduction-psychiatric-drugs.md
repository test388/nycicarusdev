The Icarus Project and [Freedom Center](http://www.freedom-center.org/)

The Icarus Project and Freedom Center's expanded 52-page guide gathers the best information we've come across and the most valuable lessons we've learned about reducing and coming off psychiatric medication. Includes info on mood stabilizers, anti-psychotics, anti-depressants, anti-anxiety drugs, risks, benefits, wellness tools, withdrawal, detailed Resource section, information for people staying on their medications, and much more. Written by Will Hall, with a 14-member health professional Advisory board providing research assistance and 24 other collaborators involved in developing and editing. The guide has photographs and art throughout, and a beautiful original cover painting by Ashley McNamara.

##About the Expanded 2nd Edition

The Harm Reduction Guide to Coming Off Psychiatric Drugs, published by The Icarus Project and Freedom Center five years ago, is now available in a revised edition!The new second edition has expanded Resources, scores of new collaborators and Advisors, new topics, more detail on the reducing and coming off process, and additional ideas for harm reduction and staying on medications.

Thousands of people worldwide have used this Guide to help themselves and people they know become more empowered around medications, including coming off. Even professionals and mental health agency staff have been downloading the free guide, to fill gaps in their own knowledge and give to their clients. Now the Guide in its second edition is even better, incorporating reader feedback and new ideas.

Since being published, the Guide has been translated into Spanish, Greek, and German, was featured in the Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing, and has been used as workshop and training curriculum. 5 years ago what seemed to many as an unspeakable topic too radical for print has proven to be wildly successful. It's helping people around the world, in the words of the introduction, to "trust themselves more and take better care of one another." 

What are some of the differences with the new Second Edition? More than twice as many Collaborators and Health Care Advisors, additional art and graphics. A Revised science discussion, to reflect new popular awareness of neuroplasticity, neurogenesis, and epigentics. A more comprehensive section on staying on meds and harm reduction, including a list of common tests Additional nutrition and holistic health advice New conclusion on looking to the future and redefining "normal"
