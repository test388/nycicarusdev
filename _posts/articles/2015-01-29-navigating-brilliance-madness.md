##A Reader & Roadmap Of Bipolar Worlds (10th Anniversary Edition)

This book emerged out of our website, the Icarus Project, which has been helping a brilliant and disparate group of folks find ways to talk about manic depression that make sense to us, the people living with it, and helps us to live better lives rather than backing us into corners. This book began as a way of bringing these conversations onto the written page and into the hands of people who might not spend time on the internet. It has evolved to be a set of alternative roadmaps for people like us who are trying to take care of ourselves and live out our dreams." Almost 100 oversize pages of 'mad pride' and analysis. Now in a new, expanded paperback book edition!
