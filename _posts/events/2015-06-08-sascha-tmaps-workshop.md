### T-MAPs Workshops with Sascha co-founder The Icarus Project

**Howie the Harp Center**
**2090 Adam Clayton Powell Jr Blvd # 12**

Hey NYC Icarus Community! Please spread the word that I'm going to be facilitating 2 FREE 4-day long workshops at the awesome Howie the Harp center in Harlem starting next week and it's going to be pretty amazing, especially if we get some folks from around the city who are familiar with The Icarus Project to come out to it. It will be Monday through Thursday from noon till 4 so if you find yourself with the time on your hands come hang out with us and eat food and play and make a T-MAP. The basic idea is that we're building community together. Below is the workshop description with a link to the registration and if you have any questions please feel free to write me directly! Please share this with anyone you think might find it useful. Mad love, Sascha

Transformative Mutual Aid Practices (T-MAPs) is a set of community-developed workshops that provide tools and space for building a personal “map” of resilience practices and local cultural resources. Each participant collaborates with the group to complete a personalized booklet (or “T-MAP”) of reminder documents that can be used as a guide for navigating challenging times and communicating with the important people in their lives. Through a mix of collective brainstorming, creative story-telling, theater games, art/collage making, and breath/mindfulness practices, the group is guided through a process to develop greater personal wellness and collective transformation.
