From the [Breaking Point Website](http://www.wnyc.org/series/breaking-point/): In New York City, one out of every three kids is growing up in poverty. Most of these children will thrive in the embrace of loving families and willing communities.

For those who don’t, new research suggests the constant stress of being poor can alter young brains and contribute to mental illness down the line. Yet four decades after New York closed its mental asylums, it has yet to build a new system that provides adequate care.

One sign of neglect – our jails and prisons are swollen with more than 10,000 inmates who have psychiatric problems.

WNYC's Cindy Rodriguez examines the nexus of poverty, mental health and the criminal justice system in this four-part series.
