## Voices From the British Psychological Society

"We think that the radical idea that ‘psychosis’ can be understood and treated in the same way as other psychological problems has the potential to revolutionize our mental health services. In the past we have often seen drugs as the most important form of treatment. Whilst they have a place, we now need to concentrate on helping each person to make sense of their experiences and find the support that works for them. Perhaps one day, too, the default approach in psychosis services will be a psychological one, with a psychological formulation driving every decision and the content of every conversation. We hope that our document will also contribute to a sea change in attitudes so that rather than being seen as somehow alien and stigmatised, people who experience psychosis will find those around them accepting, open-minded and willing to help."

You can find Anne Cook at Mad in America ([madinamerica.com](https://madinamerica.com)) or Peter Kinderman at peterkinderman.blogspot.com to find out more about their contributions to a reconceptualization of mental illness. Please bring your thoughts and ideas to continue this important conversation!

- mad love!
