### “What happened to you?” A discussion and gathering on trauma and emotional distress with Hearing Voices NYC

**Thursday, June 18th, 2015**
**6:30 pm - 8:30 pm**
**Jefferson Market Library**
**425 Avenue of the Americas between 9th and 10th Ave**
**New York, NY**

NYC Icarus is co-sponsoring an event with Hearing Voices NYC -- if you are unfamiliar with The Hearing Voices Network and what they do, check it out here: 
[http://www.hearing-voices.org](http://www.hearing-voices.org)

We are encouraging those in our community who identify as voice-hearers or would like to get involved in peer support in New York (including groups with Icarus Project) to attend a mixer at the Jefferson Market Library THIS THURSDAY JUNE 18 from 6:30-8:30. 

There will be a short film followed by a discussion, and talk about future steps toward peer support.

Mad love to you all as we begin the dog days of summer. As an extra bonus, the Jefferson Market Library is made of stone, cool to the touch and looks like a magic castle.
