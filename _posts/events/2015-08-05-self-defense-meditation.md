### Self Defense Meditation from the Trenches of Madness.

#### A free meditation workshop with dance music, black lights, special effects lighting and free fractal glasses? Hell yes!

**Wednesday, August 5th, 2015**
**7:00 pm - 9:00 pm**
**Bluestockings Books**
**3172 Allen Street**
**New York, NY**

We’ll be learning mediation techniques so simple and effective they can be used in the midst of severe anxiety, paranoia and depression: point meditation and extension meditation. Point mediation involves focusing on a point to the exclusion of all other thoughts and surroundings. Extension meditation blocks out thoughts and surroundings by focusing on visualizations and spatial relationships. These unpretentious dead simple techniques can be used in the midst of paranoia and intense suicidal ideation. They can also be used to combat simple anxiety and stress.

We’ll be using fractal glasses and music to gradually increase the amount stimulus we manage with mediation. Black lights will be used to help illustrate useful visualizations for extension meditation. There will also be an introductory video synced with fluctuating sounds and lights. This workshop is being given by NYC Icarus organizer Curt White who’s been honing these techniques since he was 9 years old (for real, this stuff has saved my life). 


Hope to see you there!

Mad love,
Icarus Project NYC
