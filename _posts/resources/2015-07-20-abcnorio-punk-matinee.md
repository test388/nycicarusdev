### ABC No Rio Punk/Hardcore Matinee

#### Doors open for shows at 3:00 PM every Saturday at 156 Rivington Street. Shows begin by 3:30 PM or 4:00 PM. For information on bands/tickets, please visit website.

For more than fifteen years ABC No Rio's Saturday Matinee has been run by a volunteer collective dedicated to providing an all-ages venue for the independent punk and hardcore music scene.

We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive scene where all can feel welcome and comfortable, regardless of race, gender or sexual identity. We do not book racist, sexist or homophobic bands.We are only a small part of the ABC No Rio community. ABC itself has been in operation as a community arts space since 1980, and it houses lots of projects and facilities including a zine library, a darkroom, a printshop, a computer center, NYC Food Not Bombs, poetry readings, improv music nights, and an art gallery. ABC also recently became home to the Time's Up! bike workshop. As of June 29, 2006, we officially gained ownership of our property from the city, with the condition that we raise the money to rehabilitate the building and dedicate it to community use. This project will include completely rebuilding it, plus an expansion and incorporation of green technologies. It turns out this kind of extensive construction is incredibly expensive. We are in the process of raising funds for it, but we're still quite far from our goal. For more information on the renovations and info on donating, visit http://www.abcnorio.org/support/support.html. Benefit shows and ideas are also always welcome.
