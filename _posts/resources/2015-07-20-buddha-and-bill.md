### Addiction & Recovery: The Buddha and Bill W.

2500 years ago the Buddha said craving and attachment is the cause of suffering. In the 1930’s Bill Wilson started the first Twelve-Step program that worked with a deep form of craving and suffering: addictions. In these monthly meetings, we explore the ways that Buddhism and the Steps support and complement each other and can deepen our spiritual lives. The meetings include Buddhist meditation practices, interactive exercises, dharma talks and discussion.

The evenings are open to all who are interested. You need not be in a Twelve Step program nor have a background in Buddhism.

Fee by donation: Suggested starting donation is $15 but whatever you offer is greatly appreciated and no one is ever turned away for lack of funds. For this event  all donations are split evenly between the teacher(s) and NYI.
