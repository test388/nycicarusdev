excerpt: "The Mental Health Empowerment Project was founded on the belief that people who have been involved in the mental health system could voluntarily come together to help themselves and one another in a trusting, open, and supportive environment. MHEP believes that through the power of self-help, people can move from dependency, self-destruction, or hopelessness, to finding personal satisfaction, connectedness, and a new purpose in life."

### PEER SUPPORT: Mental Health Empowerment Project

#### Schedule and Locations: [http://www.mhepinc.org/peer-support/ny-peer-run-programs](http://www.mhepinc.org/peer-support/ny-peer-run-programs)

The Mental Health Empowerment Project was founded on the belief that people who have been involved in the mental health system could voluntarily come together to help themselves and one another in a trusting, open, and supportive environment. MHEP believes that through the power of self-help, people can move from dependency, self-destruction, or hopelessness, to finding personal satisfaction, connectedness, and a new purpose in life.

MHEP offers a variety of ways to help individuals identify their strengths, gifts and talents and discover a passion — something to give one’s life new meaning and connect to one’s personal power through the power of self-help.

"When people discover what they have,they find power.
When people join together in new connections and relationships, they build power.
When people become more productive together, they exercise their power to address problems and realize dreams."

- Mike Green
