Our regional training centers are three-dimensional spaces dedicated to cutting-edge coffee education and community engagement. Each training center serves not only as a regional focal point for professional coffee education and industry innovation, but also as a hub of taste exploration and cultural exchange.

Furnished with state-of-the-art equipment and staffed by our world-class coffee educators, our training centers make up a closely connected network of classrooms for our Counter Intelligence coffee education curriculum, which consists of a variety of focused labs, classes, and seminars. Our training centers also provide the perfect environments for our ongoing series of public Friday Coffee Cuppings and community events.
