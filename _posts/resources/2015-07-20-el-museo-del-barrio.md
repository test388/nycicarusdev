El Museo del Barrio—located on Fifth Avenue’s Museum Mile—specializes in Puerto Rican, Caribbean and Latin American art, the only museum in New York City with these Latino cultures at its core. In addition to its extensive fine arts collection, El Museo hosts a series of cultural festivities, youth and educational programming and literary discussions. Celebrating its 40th anniversary, El Museo has undergone an award-winning redesign, framing the museum with a sparkling glass facade and a spacious new courtyard, introducing modernized galleries to house the museum’s temporary and permanent collections, and adding an expanded shop and Pan-Latin café.
